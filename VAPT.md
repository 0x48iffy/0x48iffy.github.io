## - Our Services

### - External Penetration Testing
An engineer acts like an attacker hacking in from the outside with an end goal of breaking into your network from the perimeter. We follow a detailed methodology, including performing reconnaissance, full TCP and UDP port scanning and enumeration, exploitation, credential stuffing and password spraying attacks, and more.


### - Internal Penetration Testing
An engineer emulates an attacker hacking from inside the network with an end goal of gaining access to sensitive accounts, documents, and obtaining domain admin credentials.  Common attacks scenarios include LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning, SMB relay, kerberoasting, pass-the-hash, pass-the-password, golden and silver ticket attacks, and more.

### - Webapplication Penetration Testing
Web application testing measures the security posture of your website and/or custom developed application. We perform full unauthenticated and authenticated testing based on strict OWASP guidelines. Our experts focus on identifying weak points across the entire web application to ensure your applications and data stay safe.
